# lagos-image-extraction
This project focuses on building a comprehensive image dataset of LEGO sets associated with specific Lagos IDs by scraping data from multiple LEGO-related websites. The primary goal is to extract high-quality set images and metadata from trusted sources and organize them for downstream use (e.g., ML training, cataloging, analysis).
